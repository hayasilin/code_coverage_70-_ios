# Sample code of Test-Driven iOS Development with Swift 4

This is a iOS project that I make by following the sample code in Dr. Dominik Hauser's book [Test-Driven iOS Development with Swift 4](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-iOS-Development-Swift-maintainable/dp/1788475704)

This iOS project demonstrates how to write unit tests and UI tests with Swift 4.
In addition, the iOS project's code coverage reaches **70%**.

If you want to know more about **unit testing in iOS**, you can check my [iOS Unit Tests Guide](https://github.com/hayasilin/unit-tests-ios-guide).

The book's cover is below:
